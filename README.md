# README-generator

## Description
  
In order to save time when creating a quality repo, I have worked to develop an application using the inquirer package to automate the task k of righting a high quality README.md file. I learned how to install and import packages using the require method, how to access functions from other .js files, and how to use node.js in order to run packages and execute applications from the CLI.
